Description: A responsive grid based layout that supports multiple zones. This theme is based on the 320 & Up boilerplate created by Andy Clarke. As such, it required a custom Document.cshtml file. This theme also uses The Theme Machine as it's base for CSS and HTML structure. This theme supports a branding image at multiple resolutions for the header as well as touch icons for mobile devices. You'll want to replace these images...derp.
